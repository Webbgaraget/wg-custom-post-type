# WG Custom Post Type
_â€¦or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Custom Post Type_

`WG_Custom_Post_Type` is a library created to simplify common tasks when developing Custom Post Types (CPT:s) for WordPress.

Along with the basic functions for creating the CPT:s and adding taxonomies and meta boxes, you are
handed some convenience methods for playing with hygiene factors at the wp-admin side such as menu icons and help tabs.


1. Speed up your WordPress CPT development with a simplified interface
1. Say goodbye to all those action and filter callbacks that uglifies your code
1. Make the administration more user friendly with icons and help tabs
1. Enjoy a chained interface

### Keepin' it WP yo

While trying to make the interface as easy as possible for the developer, our aim is to still keep as close to the WordPress
way of doing things as possible. Why you ask? Simple: It's WordPress you walk, and WordPress you shall talk.

### Dependencies

* The library [wg-meta-box](http://github.com/webbgaraget/wg-meta-box "wg-meta-box @ Github") is used for adding meta boxes. `wg-meta-box`
is added as a submodule to this repository, see below on how to initialize it.

* The plugin [Multiple Post Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multiple-post-thumbnails/) is used for adding multiple featured images. You
need to install and activate the plugin in order to use this functionality.


## Getting started

To get started using this library, go ahead and clone the repo into the folder of choice.

	git clone git@github.com:Webbgaraget/wg-custom-post-type

If you're interested in adding meta boxes for your CPT (you probably are), initialise the submodule with the following command (ran from the root of the newly cloned git repo)

	git submodule update --init

And you're golden!

## Example: Creating your first custom post type

This is a simple example on how to create a CPT for Events:

	// Labels
	$labels = array(
		'name'               => 'Events',
		'singular_name'      => 'Event',
		'all_items'          => 'All events',
		'add_new'            => 'Add new',
		'add_new_item'       => 'Add event',
		'edit_item'          => 'Edit event',
		'new_item'           => 'New event',
		'view_item'          => 'View event',
		'search_items'       => 'Search events',
		'not_found'          => 'No event found',
		'not_found_in_trash' => 'No event found in trash',
	);

	// Create the CPT
	$event = new WG_Custom_Post_Type( 'event', array(
	    'capability_type' => 'page',
		'labels'          => $labels,
		'hierarchial'     => true,
		'supports'        => array( 'title' ),
	) );
	
	// Create a meta box and set a placeholder text to the title field on the edit screen
	$event
		->set_title_placeholder( 'Enter event title here!' )
		->add_meta_box( 'event_info', 'Event information', array(
			'date' => array(
		        'type'  => 'date',
		        'label' => 'Date',
		    ),
		    'time' => array(
		        'type'  => 'text',
		        'label' => 'Time',
		    )
		) );
	
Note how the labels and options arrays are identical to the ones you usually pass to `register_post_type()`.

## Method documentation
